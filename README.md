This a template project for a foreground service in android using kotlin.
I also use this project to explore some ideas of how to integrate foreground service and activity, using compose as ui, livedata vs flow, using coroutine, update the notification ui and adding action in notification.
Each exploration will be manifest as a commit in the main branch. And for each exploration i will develop in its own branch.
